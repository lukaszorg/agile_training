    <h1>Big bird diet</h1> 
    <h2>Birdseed!!!!<br>   
      Big Bird not only likes birdseed, but often has snacks where birdseed is the main ingredient.<br>
      One of Big Bird's favorite snacks is Birdseed Milkshakes, which he often has at Hooper's Store.<br>
      A birdseed cake for his nestwarming party, a chocolate covered birdseed, birdseed cookies, birdseed toast for breakfast.<br>
      There is not a single thing you can't do from a birdseed.
